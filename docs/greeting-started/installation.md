    # macOS/Linux:
    source citizenai-env/bin/activate
    ```

## Verification

After installation, verify that everything is working correctly:

```bash
# Run the demo version (lightweight, no AI dependencies)
python app_demo.py

# You should see output similar to:
# * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
# * Debug mode: on
```

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`. You should see the CitizenAI interface.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

??? question "Python version issues"
    If you're getting Python version errors:
    
    ```bash
    # Check your Python version
    python --version
    
    # If using Python 3.11+ but still getting errors, try:
    python3 --version
    python3.11 --version
    ```

??? question "Permission errors during installation"
    On Windows, try running as administrator:
    ```bash
    # Run command prompt as administrator
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
    On macOS/Linux:
    ```bash
    sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
    # Or better, use a virtual environment
    ```

??? question "Module not found errors"
    Ensure you're in the correct directory and virtual environment:
    ```bash
    # Check current directory
    pwd  # or cd on Windows
    
    # Ensure virtual environment is activated
    which python  # or where python on Windows
    ```
